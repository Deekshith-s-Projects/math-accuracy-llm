Index=84 - Conversation History column - the last entry in the list in this string is incomplete, so got it from the same column where Index=85 and updated it in the CSV file.

Human Evaluation seems to be incorrect in some cases as mentioned in the Problem Statement. So, added a new column "human_eval_corrected" to incorporate my opinions on the human evaluation. But, this needs a lot of manual effort, so leaving it out of scope of this project. Can be worked on in the future.
